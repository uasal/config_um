# Optical Designs
Separate information by using sub-directories within this folder based on what the optical design is in relations too. General information for each optical design can be added to this `README.md` or just link to any `README.md` files added in addition to those sub-directories.

**Example:** telescope+esc, telescope+ifs, telescope-only

### Opto-Mechanical Design Reference Drawing

ULT-ICD-0200.pdf (found on the [Steward PDM Vault](https://escpdm.as.arizona.edu/solidworkspdm/Steward_Obs_PDM/LAZ/ULT/ICD/ULT-ICD-0200)) is the system-level opto-mechanical Design Reference Drawing that should be used as the reference when describing the opto-mechanical system.
The detailed optical parameters are as-designed and therefore are expected to change after fabrication.
The spacing between the optics is not expected to change, except to compensate for any fabrication errors.

### Optical design files for only the telescope


#### Lazuli_Mark-11

Initial release which was used in the preliminary stop analysis.
This is known to not be the final optical design as it has known issues with scattered light minimization and the instrument envelopes.
