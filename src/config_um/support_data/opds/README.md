# OPDS
OPD maps are found in the uasal_archive repository. For OPD map support, follow these steps:
1. Clone the uasal_archive repository to your local machine.
2. Setup the environment variable `UASAL_ARCHIVE` to point to where you cloned uasal_archive on your local machine. See setup_env_variables.rst in the uasal_development_guide repository for detailed instructions on how to do this.
