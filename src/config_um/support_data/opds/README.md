# OPDS
OPD maps should not be added to here via git-lfs right now. Grab OPD maps from [Box](https://arizona.app.box.com/folder/245321428353) and move them to this location when using locally. Downloaded maps should be placed in their relevant /support_data/opds/ folders for use in end-to-end modeling.

_List any highlight OPD map information this location if not already present on [Box](https://arizona.app.box.com/folder/245321428353)._
